When answering my Python's questions, I prefer you to answer them in
[MD](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) format. How can I say 'give me the answer in MD format' so that it is clear to you?

There are a couple of ways to clearly indicate your preference for Markdown formatted answers for Python questions:

### Explicit Request:

You can directly state your preference at the beginning of your question. For example:

> **Please answer in Markdown format:**
  How to tell if a parameter of def in Python is in bytes?


### Include keywords:

Include keywords like *Markdown* or *MD* in your question to signal your preference. Here are some examples:

> Can you answer my Python question in Markdown (How to check parameter type in Python?)

> I have a Python question about exceptions. Could you provide the answer in MD format?

### Phrases:

Use phrases that convey your desire for formatted text:

> I'd appreciate it if you could answer in a Markdown format.

>  Is it possible to get the answer in Markdown? (This question about Python exceptions)

 By using any of these methods, you'll effectively communicate your preference for Markdown formatted responses for your Python questions. I'll be able to understand your request and tailor my response accordingly.
